## 1. HIPAA Compliance Matrix

This section maps all HIPAA Security Rule requirements under 45 CFR Part 164 Subpart C to specific OpenMedRecord system controls and their implementation status.

### 1.1 Access Controls -- 164.312(a)

| HIPAA Reference | Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 164.312(a)(1) | Access Control -- Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain ePHI to allow access only to authorized persons or software programs. | OpenMedRecord enforces role-based access control (RBAC) at the application layer. Every API endpoint and UI route is gated by permission checks. Access policies are defined in a centralized policy engine and evaluated at runtime before any data is returned. | Implemented |
| 164.312(a)(2)(i) | Unique User Identification -- Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity. | Each user account is assigned a system-generated UUID at registration. User identifiers are immutable and never recycled. All audit log entries reference these UUIDs. Local accounts use email as the human-readable identifier; federated accounts are linked via IdP subject claims. | Implemented |
| 164.312(a)(2)(ii) | Emergency Access Procedure -- Establish and implement procedures for obtaining necessary ePHI during an emergency. | A break-glass mechanism allows designated emergency roles to bypass normal access restrictions. Break-glass events require a reason code, are logged with elevated audit detail, trigger real-time alerts to the privacy officer, and automatically expire after a configurable time window (60 minutes default, configurable maximum of 4 hours with security officer approval). Post-incident review is mandatory. | Implemented |
| 164.312(a)(2)(iii) | Automatic Logoff -- Implement electronic procedures that terminate a session after a predetermined time of inactivity. | Server-side sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity (configurable per organizational policy, minimum 5 minutes). The frontend detects idle state and displays a warning 2 minutes before expiry. JWT refresh tokens are revoked on logoff. WebSocket connections are terminated on session expiry. | Implemented |
| 164.312(a)(2)(iv) | Encryption and Decryption -- Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt ePHI. | All ePHI at rest is encrypted using AES-256-GCM. Encryption keys are managed through an external KMS (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault). Key rotation follows a tiered schedule: KMS Customer Master Keys (CMK) rotate annually via auto-rotation; Data Encryption Keys (DEK) rotate every 90 days; JWT signing keys rotate annually with a 7-day overlap period for graceful transition. Database-level Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) provides a secondary encryption layer. Application-level field encryption protects highly sensitive fields (SSN, diagnosis codes) with per-tenant keys. | Implemented |

### 1.2 Audit Controls -- 164.312(b)

| HIPAA Reference | Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 164.312(b) | Audit Controls -- Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI. | OpenMedRecord maintains a comprehensive, append-only audit log. Every access, modification, deletion, and export of ePHI is recorded with: timestamp (UTC, NTP-synchronized), user UUID, source IP address, action type, resource identifier, previous and new values (for modifications), and session correlation ID. Logs are written to a tamper-evident store using cryptographic chaining (each entry includes a SHA-256 hash of the previous entry). Logs are retained for a minimum of 7 years per HIPAA requirements. | Implemented |
| 164.312(b) -- Review Mechanism | Procedures for regular review of audit logs. | Automated log analysis runs continuously using configurable rules that detect anomalies: unusual access patterns, after-hours access, bulk data retrieval, privilege escalation, and repeated authentication failures. Weekly audit summaries are generated for the compliance team. Quarterly manual reviews of flagged events are documented. | Implemented |
| 164.312(b) -- Log Protection | Protection of audit log integrity. | Audit logs are stored in a write-once, append-only data store separate from the application database. Logs are digitally signed using the system's audit signing key. Log integrity is verified daily via hash chain validation. Logs cannot be modified or deleted by any user, including system administrators. Backup copies are stored in a geographically separate location. | Implemented |

#### Accounting of Disclosures (HIPAA 164.528)

The following disclosure-specific audit events are tracked:

- `phi.disclosure.external` -- Disclosure to external parties (insurers, legal, etc.)
- `phi.disclosure.public_health` -- Public health reporting disclosures
- `phi.disclosure.legal` -- Court-ordered or law enforcement disclosures
- `phi.disclosure.research` -- Research-related disclosures (IRB-approved)

Each disclosure audit event includes: recipient identity, purpose, legal basis, scope of information disclosed, and consent reference (if applicable). Patients can request an accounting of disclosures for the prior 7 years.

### 1.3 Integrity Controls -- 164.312(c)

| HIPAA Reference | Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 164.312(c)(1) | Integrity -- Implement policies and procedures to protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction. | All database operations on ePHI tables use serializable transaction isolation to prevent dirty reads and phantom writes. Optimistic concurrency control with version vectors prevents conflicting updates. Soft deletes are used for all clinical records; physical deletion requires dual authorization and is audited. Referential integrity is enforced at the database level. | Implemented |
| 164.312(c)(2) | Mechanism to Authenticate ePHI -- Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that ePHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. | Cryptographic checksums (SHA-256) are computed and stored for every clinical document and record version. Integrity verification runs as a nightly batch job and can be triggered on demand. Any detected integrity violation triggers an immediate alert and the affected record is flagged for review. Digital signatures (ECDSA P-256) are applied to finalized clinical documents (notes, orders, prescriptions). | Implemented |

### 1.4 Transmission Security -- 164.312(e)

| HIPAA Reference | Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 164.312(e)(1) | Transmission Security -- Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network. | All network communication uses TLS 1.3 minimum for new integrations; TLS 1.2 accepted for legacy systems with documented risk acceptance. TLS 1.1 and below are blocked. Cipher suites are restricted to AEAD algorithms (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305). Certificate pinning is enforced for mobile clients. Internal service-to-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with short-lived certificates issued by an internal CA. | Implemented |
| 164.312(e)(2)(i) | Integrity Controls for Transmission -- Implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted ePHI is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of. | Message integrity is verified at the transport layer via TLS and at the application layer via HMAC-SHA256 signatures on API payloads containing ePHI. FHIR messages include integrity headers. HL7v2 messages include checksum segments. File transfers use SHA-256 checksums verified by the receiver before processing. | Implemented |
| 164.312(e)(2)(ii) | Encryption for Transmission -- Implement a mechanism to encrypt ePHI whenever deemed appropriate. | Encryption is mandatory (not optional) for all ePHI transmission. TLS 1.3 minimum for new integrations; TLS 1.2 accepted for legacy systems with documented risk acceptance. TLS 1.1 and below are blocked. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are set with a one-year max-age and includeSubDomains. Plaintext HTTP endpoints are not exposed. Email notifications containing ePHI use S/MIME encryption. Direct messaging uses the Direct Standard encryption protocol. | Implemented |

### 1.5 Authentication -- 164.312(d)

| HIPAA Reference | Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 164.312(d) | Person or Entity Authentication -- Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to ePHI is the one claimed. | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all users accessing ePHI. Supported MFA methods: TOTP (RFC 6238), WebAuthn/FIDO2 hardware keys, and push notifications via authenticator apps. Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements: 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters. Passwords are hashed using Argon2id with a minimum memory cost of 64 MB. Previous 24 passwords are tracked to prevent reuse. Account lockout after 5 consecutive failed attempts with progressive backoff (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes). | Implemented |
| 164.312(d) -- Entity Authentication | Authenticate entities (systems, applications) accessing ePHI. | Service-to-service authentication uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials with signed JWTs (RS256). API keys are issued per integration partner and scoped to specific FHIR resource types. External systems are registered in the integration registry with their public keys. Certificate-based mutual TLS authenticates infrastructure components. | Implemented |

## 5. 21st Century Cures Act Compliance

### 5.1 Information Blocking Prevention

The 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255) and the ONC Information Blocking Rule (45 CFR Part 171) prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information (EHI).

#### 5.1.1 Information Blocking Prevention Measures

| Measure | Description | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Open API Architecture | OpenMedRecord provides standards-based APIs that do not impose unnecessary barriers to access. | FHIR R4 API with SMART on FHIR authorization. No proprietary API locks. Full USCDI v3 data set available via API. API documentation is publicly available. |
| No Fees for Access | No fees are charged for API access to EHI by patients or their authorized representatives. | Patient-facing API is free. Developer sandbox is free. Production API access for authorized apps has no per-transaction fees. |
| No Unnecessary Restrictions | Access to EHI is not restricted beyond what is required by law or permitted by the information blocking exceptions. | API scopes are granular and aligned with the minimum necessary principle. Restrictions are documented and justified. Blanket denials are not permitted. |
| Timely Response | Requests for EHI are fulfilled in a timely manner. | API requests are processed in real-time. Bulk export requests are initiated within 1 hour. Patient access requests via the portal are fulfilled immediately for data already in the system. |
| No Interference with Exchange | The system does not interfere with the ability of authorized entities to access, exchange, or use EHI. | Interoperability interfaces use open standards (FHIR, C-CDA, HL7v2). No proprietary message formats are required. Data is not locked into proprietary formats. |
| Exception Documentation | When access is restricted under a permitted exception, the basis is documented. | The system logs all access denials with the applicable exception category (privacy, security, infeasibility, health IT performance, content and manner, fees, licensing). |

#### 5.1.2 Information Blocking Exceptions Applied

| Exception (45 CFR 171) | Application in OpenMedRecord |
|---|---|
| 171.201 -- Preventing Harm | Clinical decision rules may restrict access to information when disclosure could endanger the patient or another person (e.g., domestic violence situations). Restrictions require clinician documentation. |
| 171.202 -- Privacy | Patient consent preferences are enforced. Data segmentation for privacy (DS4P) restricts access to sensitive information categories based on patient consent. State privacy laws more restrictive than HIPAA are supported through configurable rule sets. |
| 171.203 -- Security | Security controls may temporarily restrict access during active security incidents or when access would compromise system integrity. Restrictions are time-limited and documented. |
| 171.204 -- Infeasibility | The system documents any technical limitations that temporarily prevent data exchange (e.g., interface downtime, format incompatibility). Workarounds are provided where feasible. |
| 171.205 -- Health IT Performance | Maintenance windows may temporarily limit API availability. Planned maintenance is communicated in advance. Unplanned outages are resolved within the defined RTO. |
| 171.206 -- Content and Manner | EHI is made available through the standardized API (FHIR R4) in the content and manner required by the rule. Alternative means of access are provided when the standardized API does not support a specific use case. |
| 171.207 -- Fees | No fees are charged that could constitute information blocking. Fees for value-added services (analytics, custom integrations) do not restrict access to the underlying EHI. |
| 171.208 -- Licensing | Open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0) does not restrict access to or use of EHI. API specifications are publicly available without licensing restrictions. |

### 5.2 Patient Access API Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Patient Access API | FHIR R4 API with SMART on FHIR authorization provides patients with access to their claims and clinical data. | HL7 FHIR R4, SMART on FHIR v2 |

| Third-Party App Access | Patients can authorize third-party applications to access their data through the SMART on FHIR framework. Granular scopes allow patients to control which data categories are shared. Token revocation allows patients to withdraw access at any time. | SMART on FHIR v2, OAuth 2.0 |
| Provider Directory API | FHIR-based provider directory enables patients and applications to discover providers and their services. | FHIR R4, PDex Plan Net IG |
| Payer-to-Payer Exchange | Support for payer-to-payer data exchange to ensure continuity of care when patients change health plans. | FHIR R4, PDex IG |

### 5.3 EHI Export Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|
| Single Patient Export | Export all EHI for an individual patient in a computable electronic format. | FHIR Patient/$everything operation returns all resources associated with the patient. Export includes: clinical data, administrative data, billing data, documents, images (references), and audit trail. Output formats: FHIR Bundle (JSON), C-CDA, and CSV. |
| Bulk Data Export | Export EHI for all patients or a defined population in a computable electronic format. | FHIR Bulk Data Access ($export) supports system-level and group-level export. Asynchronous processing with status polling. Output in NDJSON format. Supports resource type filtering and date range filtering. |
| Export Completeness | Export includes all EHI maintained by the system without omission. | Export completeness is verified by comparing the export resource count against the database record count for the patient or population. Missing resource types are flagged. Export log includes a completeness attestation. |
| Export Format | EHI is exported in a computable electronic format that can be ingested by other systems. | Primary format: FHIR R4 JSON. Secondary formats: C-CDA R2.1 XML, CSV (tabular data), DICOM (imaging references). Format selection is available at export time. |
| Export Timeliness | Export requests are fulfilled in a timely manner. | Single patient exports are completed within 1 hour. Bulk exports are initiated within 1 hour and completed based on volume (target: 1 million resources per hour). Patients are notified when export is ready for download. |
| Export Security | Exported data is protected in transit and at rest. | Export files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM. Download links use time-limited, signed URLs (default expiry: 24 hours). Export access requires authentication. Export events are logged. |
| No Export Fees | No fees are charged for EHI export when requested by the patient or their authorized representative. | Patient-initiated exports are free. Provider-initiated exports for treatment purposes are free. Administrative exports may incur processing fees for very large volumes. |

## 6. Security Controls Catalog

This section provides a detailed catalog of all security controls implemented in OpenMedRecord. Each control is assigned a unique identifier and mapped to applicable regulatory frameworks.

### 6.1 Access Control (SC-001 through SC-015)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-001 | Role-Based Access Control | The system enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to ePHI based on the user's assigned role. Predefined roles include: physician, nurse, medical assistant, pharmacist, lab technician, billing specialist, administrator, patient, and custom roles. Each role is associated with a set of permissions that define which FHIR resource types can be accessed and which operations (create, read, update, delete, search) are permitted. | Access Control | 164.312(a)(1), 164.308(a)(4) | CC6.1, CC6.3 | 01.a, 01.c, 01.v | Permissions are evaluated by the authorization middleware on every API request. Role definitions are stored in the database and cached in memory. Role changes take effect immediately. Default roles are provided; organizations can create custom roles. |
| SC-002 | Multi-Factor Authentication | The system requires multi-factor authentication for all users accessing ePHI. Users must authenticate with a primary factor (password) and a secondary factor (TOTP, WebAuthn/FIDO2 key, or push notification). MFA enrollment is enforced at first login. MFA can be required per session or per sensitive operation (step-up authentication). | Authentication | 164.312(d) | CC6.1 | 01.q | MFA is implemented using the authenticator library integrated into the authentication service. TOTP secrets are encrypted at rest. WebAuthn credentials are stored as public key attestations. Push notifications use encrypted channels. Recovery codes are generated at enrollment (10 single-use codes). |
| SC-003 | Unique User Identification | Each user is assigned a system-generated UUID that is immutable and never recycled. The UUID is used as the primary identifier in all audit log entries, access control decisions, and system records. Human-readable identifiers (email, username) are used for display purposes only. | Identity Management | 164.312(a)(2)(i) | CC6.2 | 01.b | UUIDs are generated using UUIDv4 (cryptographically random). The UUID is assigned at account creation and cannot be changed. Deactivated accounts retain their UUID indefinitely to maintain audit trail integrity. |
| SC-004 | Session Management | User sessions are managed server-side with configurable inactivity timeout (default: 15 minutes, minimum: 5 minutes, maximum: 60 minutes). Sessions are bound to the authenticated user, source IP range, and user agent. Session tokens are cryptographically random (256-bit). Concurrent session limits are configurable. | Access Control | 164.312(a)(2)(iii) | CC6.1 | 01.a | Sessions are stored in an encrypted, server-side session store (Redis with TLS). Session tokens are transmitted as secure, HTTP-only, SameSite=Strict cookies. JWT access tokens have a short lifetime (15 minutes) and are refreshed using rotating refresh tokens. Refresh token reuse detection invalidates the entire token family. |
| SC-005 | Password Policy Enforcement | Passwords must meet configurable complexity requirements: minimum 12 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character. Password history tracks the last 24 passwords to prevent reuse. Passwords are checked against known breached password databases using k-anonymity (Have I Been Pwned API). | Authentication | 164.312(d) | CC6.1 | 01.d | Passwords are hashed using Argon2id with parameters: memory cost 64 MB, time cost 3 iterations, parallelism 4. Password strength estimation uses the zxcvbn algorithm. Real-time feedback is provided during password creation. Password expiration is configurable but not enforced by default per NIST SP 800-63B guidance. |
| SC-006 | Account Lockout | User accounts are locked after 5 consecutive failed authentication attempts. Lockout duration follows progressive backoff: 5 minutes after 5 failures, 15 minutes after 10 failures, 30 minutes after 15 failures, 60 minutes after 20 failures. Permanent lockout occurs after 25 failures and requires administrative unlock. | Authentication | 164.312(d) | CC6.1 | 01.q | Failed authentication attempts are tracked per account. Lockout counters reset after a successful authentication. IP-based rate limiting provides an additional layer: 100 authentication attempts per IP per hour. CAPTCHA is triggered after 3 failures. Lockout events are logged and alerted. |
| SC-007 | Federated Identity | The system supports federated identity through SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols. Identity federation allows organizations to use their existing identity provider (IdP) for authentication. Just-in-time provisioning creates user accounts on first federated login. Attribute mapping configures how IdP claims map to system roles and permissions. | Identity Management | 164.312(d) | CC6.2 | 01.b, 01.j | SAML 2.0 supports SP-initiated and IdP-initiated flows. OIDC supports authorization code flow with PKCE. IdP metadata is validated and stored. Session lifetime can be bound to the IdP session. Single logout (SLO) is supported for SAML. Token validation for OIDC includes issuer, audience, expiry, and signature verification. |
| SC-008 | Emergency Access (Break-Glass) | A break-glass mechanism allows designated users to access patient records outside their normal authorization scope during emergencies. Break-glass access requires: selection of an emergency reason code, acknowledgment of enhanced monitoring, and attestation that the access is for a genuine emergency. | Access Control | 164.312(a)(2)(ii) | CC6.1 | 01.v | Break-glass sessions are time-limited (60 minutes default, configurable maximum of 4 hours with security officer approval). All actions during a break-glass session are logged with elevated audit detail including screenshots of accessed records. Real-time alerts are sent to the privacy officer and the patient's primary care provider. Post-incident review is required within 72 hours. Abuse triggers disciplinary workflow. |
| SC-009 | Minimum Necessary Access | Access to ePHI is restricted to the minimum necessary information needed for the user to perform their job function. Role templates are designed to provide access only to the FHIR resource types and operations required for each clinical or administrative role. | Access Control | 164.308(a)(4), 164.502(b) | CC6.3 | 01.v | Minimum necessary is enforced through: resource-type restrictions (e.g., nurses cannot access billing resources), field-level restrictions (e.g., front desk cannot see clinical notes), and patient-population restrictions (e.g., providers can only access their own patients and referred patients). Exceptions require documented justification. |
| SC-010 | Consent-Based Access Control | Patient consent preferences are enforced in access control decisions. Consent records are stored as FHIR Consent resources. Consent categories include: general treatment, research, disclosure to specific parties, and restriction of specific data categories. | Access Control | 164.308(a)(4), 164.522 | P2.1 | 01.v | Consent rules are evaluated at the data access layer. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules. Consent status is checked in real-time. Consent changes take effect immediately. Emergency access overrides consent restrictions with enhanced auditing. Consent is captured electronically with timestamps and witness attestation where required. |
| SC-011 | API Authentication | All API access requires valid authentication credentials. Supported authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens (for user and application access), API keys (for system integrations), and mutual TLS certificates (for infrastructure components). | Authentication | 164.312(d) | CC6.1, CC6.6 | 01.j | OAuth 2.0 supports authorization code (with PKCE), client credentials, and token exchange grants. API keys are 256-bit random values, hashed for storage, scoped to specific resource types and operations, and rotatable without downtime. mTLS certificates are issued by the internal CA with short lifetimes (24 hours) and automatic renewal. |
| SC-012 | Privilege Escalation Prevention | The system prevents unauthorized privilege escalation through separation of duties enforcement, approval workflows for role changes, and runtime checks that prevent users from granting permissions they do not possess. | Access Control | 164.312(a)(1), 164.308(a)(3) | CC6.3 | 01.c | Users cannot modify their own roles or permissions. Role changes require approval from an administrator who is not the subject of the change. API endpoints validate that the requesting user has the necessary permissions to perform administrative actions. Batch operations on user permissions require dual authorization. |
| SC-013 | Access Review Automation | Automated access review workflows are generated quarterly (configurable). Managers review access for their direct reports. Reviewers can approve, modify, or revoke access. Unreviewed access is escalated after a configurable deadline. Completed reviews are archived. | Access Control | 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C) | CC6.2, CC6.3 | 01.e | Access review tasks are created automatically based on the organizational hierarchy. Reviewers are presented with the user's current roles, permissions, and recent access activity. Bulk review operations are supported. Review completion rates are tracked and reported. Non-compliant departments are escalated to the compliance team. |
| SC-014 | Contextual Access Control | Access decisions consider contextual factors beyond role and identity: time of day, source network, device posture, patient-provider relationship, and data sensitivity level. Contextual policies can deny access, require step-up authentication, or restrict available operations. | Access Control | 164.312(a)(1) | CC6.1 | 01.a | Contextual policies are defined using a policy language that supports conditions on: time ranges (e.g., restrict access outside business hours), network zones (e.g., require VPN for remote access), device attributes (e.g., require managed device), care team membership (e.g., restrict to assigned patients), and data sensitivity (e.g., require step-up MFA for 42 CFR Part 2 data). |
| SC-015 | Service Account Management | Service accounts used for system-to-system integration are managed through a dedicated lifecycle. Service accounts have: unique identifiers, scoped permissions, credential rotation schedules, activity monitoring, and ownership assignment. Service accounts cannot be used for interactive login. | Identity Management | 164.312(a)(2)(i), 164.312(d) | CC6.2 | 01.b | Service account credentials are rotated every 30 days (configurable). Unused service accounts are flagged after 90 days of inactivity. Service account permissions are reviewed quarterly. Service account actions are logged with the same detail as user actions. Credential exposure (e.g., in code repositories) triggers automatic rotation and alerting. |

### 6.2 Audit and Monitoring (SC-016 through SC-025)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-016 | Comprehensive Audit Logging | Every access, modification, deletion, query, and export of ePHI is recorded in the audit log. Each log entry contains: event ID (UUID), timestamp (UTC, NTP-synchronized), event type, user ID, session ID, source IP address, user agent, resource type, resource ID, operation, outcome (success/failure), and additional context. | Audit | 164.312(b) | CC7.1 | 09.aa | Audit logging is implemented as middleware that intercepts all API requests and database operations. Logging is synchronous for write operations and asynchronous for read operations to minimize performance impact. Log entries are structured as JSON for machine parsing. Log volume averages 500 entries per user per day. |
| SC-017 | Tamper-Evident Audit Log | Audit log entries are chained using cryptographic hashes (SHA-256). Each entry includes the hash of the previous entry, creating a verifiable chain of custody. Log integrity is verified daily through hash chain validation. Any tampering is detected and alerted. | Audit | 164.312(b) | CC7.1 | 09.ac | Hash chain verification runs as a scheduled job. The genesis hash is stored in a separate, tamper-proof location (e.g., HSM or external audit service). Verification failure triggers an immediate P1 security incident. Log entries cannot be modified or deleted through any application interface or database operation. |
| SC-018 | Audit Log Retention | Audit logs are retained for a minimum of 7 years from the date of creation, in compliance with HIPAA requirements. Retention policies are configurable to accommodate state-specific requirements that exceed the federal minimum. Archived logs are stored in cost-optimized, durable storage. | Audit | 164.312(b), 164.530(j) | CC4.1 | 12.d | Active logs are retained in the primary log store for 90 days for rapid query. Logs older than 90 days are archived to cost-optimized storage (e.g., S3 Glacier, Azure Cool Storage). Archived logs are retrievable within 24 hours. Retention hold functionality prevents deletion during legal proceedings. |
| SC-019 | Real-Time Security Monitoring | Security events are monitored in real-time using configurable detection rules. Pre-built rules detect: brute force attacks, privilege escalation attempts, unusual data access patterns, after-hours access, bulk data retrieval, and known attack signatures. | Monitoring | 164.312(b) | CC7.1, CC7.2 | 09.ab | Detection rules are defined in a domain-specific language. Rules can trigger: alerts (email, Slack, PagerDuty), incident creation, automatic response actions (account lockout, session termination), or log enrichment. Rules are evaluated in near-real-time (< 30 seconds latency). False positive rate is tracked and rules are tuned. |
| SC-020 | Anomaly Detection | Behavioral analytics establish baselines of normal user activity and detect deviations. Monitored dimensions: access volume, access times, accessed resource types, geographic location, and device characteristics. Anomaly scores are calculated and thresholds trigger alerts. | Monitoring | 164.312(b) | CC7.2 | 09.ab | Baselines are calculated per user using a rolling 30-day window. Anomaly detection uses statistical methods (z-score, IQR) and optionally machine learning models. New users inherit group baselines until individual baselines are established. Anomaly alerts include context to support investigation. |
| SC-021 | SIEM Integration | Security events are exported to external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems in standard formats. Supported output formats: CEF (Common Event Format), LEEF (Log Event Extended Format), and JSON. Supported transport: syslog (TCP/TLS), HTTPS webhook, and message queue (Kafka). | Monitoring | 164.312(b) | CC7.1 | 09.aa | Log shipping is configurable with filtering to control which event types are exported. Delivery is guaranteed through at-least-once semantics with retry. Backpressure handling prevents log loss during SIEM outages. Parsing templates are provided for common SIEM platforms (Splunk, Elastic, QRadar, Sentinel). |
| SC-022 | Access Audit Reports | Pre-built audit reports are available for common compliance queries: who accessed a specific patient's records, what records did a specific user access, authentication activity summary, privilege change history, and break-glass usage. | Audit | 164.312(b), 170.315(d)(3) | CC4.1 | 09.aa | Reports are generated on demand or on a schedule. Report output formats: PDF (human-readable), CSV (analysis), FHIR AuditEvent Bundle (interoperable). Reports can be scoped by date range, user, patient, department, or event type. Report generation is itself an audited event. |
| SC-023 | Administrative Action Logging | All administrative actions are logged in a dedicated high-security audit stream. Logged actions include: user provisioning and deprovisioning, role changes, configuration changes, policy changes, system updates, backup and restore operations, and security setting modifications. | Audit | 164.312(b), 164.308(a)(1) | CC7.1 | 09.ad | Administrative log entries include before and after state for configuration changes. Administrative sessions can be recorded (screen and command capture) for forensic purposes. Administrative logs are subject to the same tamper-evidence controls as clinical audit logs. |
| SC-024 | Patient Record Access Notification | Patients can opt in to receive notifications when their health records are accessed. Notifications include: date and time of access, name and role of the accessor, and a general description of the information accessed. Notifications are delivered via the patient portal or email. | Monitoring | 164.312(b) | P5.1 | 09.ab | Notification preferences are managed in the patient portal. Notifications are generated asynchronously to avoid performance impact. Notification content does not include specific clinical details. High-volume access (e.g., during inpatient stays) is summarized rather than generating individual notifications. |
| SC-025 | Compliance Dashboard | A real-time compliance dashboard displays the current status of all security controls, pending access reviews, open audit findings, risk posture, and regulatory compliance metrics. The dashboard is accessible to compliance officers, security administrators, and organizational leadership. | Monitoring | 164.308(a)(8) | CC4.1 | 03.a | Dashboard widgets are configurable per role. Data is refreshed in near-real-time. Drill-down capability allows investigation of specific findings. Trend charts show compliance posture over time. Dashboard data can be exported for board reporting. Alerts are displayed for controls that are out of compliance. |

### 6.3 Data Protection (SC-026 through SC-035)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-026 | Encryption at Rest (AES-256-GCM) | All ePHI stored in the database, file system, and backup storage is encrypted using AES-256-GCM. Encryption is applied at the database level (TDE) and at the application level for sensitive fields. | Data Protection | 164.312(a)(2)(iv) | CC6.1 | 10.h | Database TDE encrypts the entire database storage layer. Application-level field encryption selectively encrypts high-sensitivity fields (SSN, financial information, certain diagnosis codes) with per-tenant keys. Encryption is transparent to the application logic through a data access layer abstraction. |
| SC-027 | Encryption in Transit (TLS 1.3) | All network communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3 minimum for new integrations; TLS 1.2 accepted for legacy systems with documented risk acceptance. TLS 1.1 and below are blocked. Cipher suites are restricted to AEAD algorithms. Certificate management is automated. | Data Protection | 164.312(e)(1), 164.312(e)(2)(ii) | CC6.7 | 10.i | TLS termination occurs at the load balancer for external traffic. Internal service mesh uses mTLS with Istio or Linkerd. Certificate issuance and renewal is automated via ACME protocol (Let's Encrypt) or internal CA. Cipher suite order: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. |
| SC-028 | Key Management | Cryptographic keys are managed through an external Key Management Service (KMS). Supported KMS providers: AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault. Key lifecycle includes generation, storage, rotation, revocation, and destruction. | Data Protection | 164.312(a)(2)(iv) | CC6.1 | 10.g | Key hierarchy: master key (KMS-managed, never exported), data encryption keys (DEKs, envelope-encrypted by master key), per-tenant keys (derived from DEKs). Key rotation: KMS Customer Master Keys (CMK) rotated annually via auto-rotation; Data Encryption Keys (DEK) rotated every 90 days; JWT signing keys rotated annually with a 7-day overlap period for graceful transition. Old keys are retained for decryption of historical data. Key access is logged by the KMS. |
| SC-029 | Data Integrity Verification | Cryptographic checksums (SHA-256) are computed and stored for every clinical document and record version. Integrity verification validates that stored data has not been altered or corrupted. | Data Protection | 164.312(c)(1), 164.312(c)(2) | PI1.5 | 10.f | Checksums are computed at write time and stored alongside the data. Integrity verification runs as a nightly batch job that recomputes checksums and compares them to stored values. On-demand verification is available for individual records. Verification failures trigger P1 alerts and the affected records are flagged for investigation. |
| SC-030 | Digital Signatures | Finalized clinical documents (progress notes, orders, prescriptions, discharge summaries) are digitally signed using ECDSA P-256 to provide non-repudiation. Signatures attest that the document was authored by the signing user and has not been modified since signing. | Data Protection | 164.312(c)(2) | PI1.3 | 10.f | Signing keys are generated per user and stored in the KMS. The signing process includes: document content hash (SHA-256), user identity, timestamp, and purpose. Signature verification is available through the UI and API. Countersignature workflows are supported for documents requiring co-signature (e.g., resident notes requiring attending review). |
| SC-031 | Data Classification | All data is classified according to sensitivity level: Public, Internal, Confidential (PHI), and Restricted (highly sensitive PHI such as substance abuse, mental health, HIV status). Classification labels are stored as metadata and enforced in access control decisions. | Data Protection | 164.312(a)(1) | C1.1 | 06.d | Classification rules are applied automatically based on FHIR resource type and content. Custom classification rules can be defined per organization. Reclassification requires authorized approval. Data cannot be moved to a lower classification without review. |
| SC-032 | Data Masking and De-identification | The system provides data de-identification capabilities supporting both the Safe Harbor method (removal of 18 HIPAA identifiers) and the Expert Determination method. Data masking is available for non-production environments. | Data Protection | 164.514(a)-(c) | C1.1 | 06.d | Safe Harbor de-identification automatically removes or generalizes all 18 identifiers. Expert Determination mode allows configurable statistical de-identification. Masked datasets for testing use realistic but synthetic data generated by the masking engine. De-identification logs track what transformations were applied. |
| SC-033 | Backup Encryption | All backup data (database backups, file system backups, configuration backups) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with dedicated backup encryption keys. Backup keys are managed separately from production data keys. | Data Protection | 164.312(a)(2)(iv), 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A) | A1.2 | 10.h | Backup encryption uses envelope encryption with KMS-managed backup master keys. Backup integrity is verified after creation (checksum validation) and periodically during storage. Backup restoration is tested monthly. Backup keys are escrowed in a separate KMS region/account for disaster recovery. |
| SC-034 | Secure Data Deletion | Data deletion follows secure procedures that ensure deleted data is unrecoverable. Clinical records use soft delete (logical deletion with access restriction) with configurable retention before physical deletion. Physical deletion uses cryptographic erasure where possible. | Data Protection | 164.310(d)(2)(i) | C1.2 | 06.d | Soft-deleted records are retained for a configurable period (default: 7 years) before physical deletion. Physical deletion removes the data and destroys the per-record encryption key, rendering any residual data unreadable. Deletion of entire tenants uses cryptographic erasure by destroying the tenant master key. Deletion operations require dual authorization. |
| SC-035 | Data Loss Prevention | DLP controls monitor and restrict the movement of ePHI out of the system. Controls include: export approval workflows for bulk data, watermarking of downloaded documents with user identity, API rate limiting to prevent bulk exfiltration, and clipboard restrictions in the web application. | Data Protection | 164.312(a)(1), 164.310(d)(1) | CC6.7 | 06.d | Export thresholds are configurable (e.g., single patient export is unrestricted, exports exceeding 100 patients require approval). Downloaded documents are watermarked with username, timestamp, and a tracking ID. Print watermarking includes a QR code linking to the audit event. API rate limits for data retrieval: 1,000 resources per minute per user. |

### 6.4 Network and Infrastructure Security (SC-036 through SC-045)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-036 | Network Segmentation | The application infrastructure is deployed in a segmented network architecture. Public-facing components (load balancer, API gateway) are in a DMZ. Application servers are in a private application subnet. Databases are in an isolated data subnet with no direct internet access. | Network Security | 164.312(e)(1), 164.310(a)(1) | CC6.1, CC6.6 | 09.m | Network segmentation is enforced through VPC/VNet configuration and security groups/NSGs. Traffic flow: Internet -> WAF -> Load Balancer -> API Gateway (DMZ) -> Application Servers (App Subnet) -> Database (Data Subnet). Each tier can only communicate with its adjacent tiers. East-west traffic within a tier is restricted to necessary ports. |
| SC-037 | Web Application Firewall | A Web Application Firewall (WAF) filters all inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic. The WAF provides protection against: SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), HTTP protocol violations, and other OWASP Top 10 attacks. | Network Security | 164.312(e)(1) | CC6.1 | 09.m | WAF rules are based on the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS). Custom rules are added for application-specific protections. WAF operates in blocking mode for known attack patterns and detection mode for anomalous requests. WAF logs are integrated with the SIEM. False positive tuning is performed during deployment. |
| SC-038 | Intrusion Detection and Prevention | Network and host-based intrusion detection monitors for malicious activity. Network IDS analyzes traffic patterns for known attack signatures and anomalous behavior. Host-based IDS monitors system calls, file integrity, and process activity. | Network Security | 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) | CC7.1, CC7.2 | 09.ab | Network IDS is deployed at network boundaries and between security zones. Host-based agents monitor application servers and database servers. Detection signatures are updated daily. Alerts are classified by severity and integrated with the incident management workflow. Automated response can block malicious IPs at the firewall. |
| SC-039 | DDoS Protection | Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection is deployed to maintain system availability during volumetric attacks. Protection operates at the network layer (L3/L4) and application layer (L7). | Network Security | 164.308(a)(7)(i) | A1.1, A1.2 | 09.m | Cloud deployments leverage provider DDoS protection (AWS Shield, Azure DDoS Protection, GCP Cloud Armor). On-premises deployments use dedicated DDoS mitigation appliances. Rate limiting at the API gateway provides application-layer protection. Traffic anomaly detection triggers automatic mitigation. |
| SC-040 | API Gateway Security | All API traffic passes through an API gateway that enforces: authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request validation, and threat detection. The gateway provides a single enforcement point for API security policies. | Network Security | 164.312(a)(1), 164.312(d) | CC6.1, CC6.6 | 01.j | The API gateway validates JWT tokens, enforces RBAC policies, applies rate limits (configurable per client and endpoint), validates request schemas against OpenAPI specifications, and logs all API activity. The gateway blocks malformed requests before they reach the application. Health check endpoints are excluded from authentication. |
| SC-041 | Mutual TLS for Internal Services | Internal service-to-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate both the client and server. Each service has a unique TLS certificate issued by the internal Certificate Authority. | Network Security | 164.312(d), 164.312(e)(1) | CC6.1, CC6.6 | 10.i | mTLS is managed through a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) or application-level certificate management. Certificates are short-lived (24 hours) and automatically rotated. Certificate issuance is automated through the internal CA. Expired or revoked certificates are rejected immediately. |
| SC-042 | Container Security | Application components are deployed as containers with security hardening. Containers run as non-root users. File systems are read-only where possible. Resource limits prevent container escape. Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment. | Infrastructure Security | 164.308(a)(1) | CC6.8, CC8.1 | 09.m | Container images are built from minimal base images (distroless or Alpine). Image scanning runs in CI/CD and blocks deployment of images with critical or high vulnerabilities. Runtime security monitoring detects anomalous container behavior. Container orchestration (Kubernetes) enforces pod security policies. Secrets are injected at runtime, never embedded in images. |
| SC-043 | Infrastructure as Code Security | Infrastructure is defined and managed as code (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK). Security configurations are version-controlled and peer-reviewed. Infrastructure changes follow the same change management process as application changes. | Infrastructure Security | 164.308(a)(1) | CC8.1 | 09.m | IaC templates are scanned for security misconfigurations (Checkov, tfsec) before deployment. Security baselines (CIS benchmarks) are enforced through IaC policies. Drift detection identifies manual changes to infrastructure. Non-compliant configurations are flagged and remediated. |
| SC-044 | Vulnerability Management | Automated vulnerability scanning identifies security weaknesses in the application, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure. Vulnerabilities are tracked with remediation SLAs based on severity: Critical (24 hours), High (72 hours), Medium (30 days), Low (90 days). | Infrastructure Security | 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) | CC7.5 | 03.b | Scanning tools: SAST (static analysis) in CI/CD, DAST (dynamic analysis) in staging, dependency scanning (SCA) in CI/CD, container image scanning in CI/CD and registry, infrastructure scanning continuously. Vulnerability reports are generated weekly. Exceptions require documented risk acceptance with an expiration date. Age-based escalation ensures overdue vulnerabilities are addressed. |
| SC-045 | Patch Management | Security patches are applied according to severity-based timelines: Critical patches within 24 hours, High within 72 hours, Medium within 30 days, Low within 90 days. Patch status is tracked and reported. Emergency patching procedures enable rapid deployment for zero-day vulnerabilities. | Infrastructure Security | 164.308(a)(1) | CC7.5 | 09.m | Automated dependency updates (Dependabot, Renovate) create pull requests for security patches. Container base image updates are automated. OS-level patches are applied through automated patch management. Patch deployment follows the standard CI/CD pipeline with expedited review for critical patches. Rollback procedures are documented for each patch type. |

### 6.5 Incident Response and Business Continuity (SC-046 through SC-055)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-046 | Incident Response Plan | A documented incident response plan defines roles, responsibilities, procedures, and communication protocols for security incidents. The plan covers: detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review. | Incident Management | 164.308(a)(6)(i) | CC7.3, CC7.4 | 11.c | The incident response plan is stored in the compliance module and accessible to all incident response team members. The plan is reviewed and updated at least annually and after every significant incident. Contact lists are maintained and verified quarterly. The plan defines severity levels (P1-P4) with corresponding response timelines and escalation procedures. |
| SC-047 | Incident Detection and Alerting | Automated detection rules monitor for security incidents across all system components. Detected incidents are automatically classified, and alerts are routed to the appropriate response team based on severity and type. | Incident Management | 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D), 164.308(a)(6)(ii) | CC7.1, CC7.2 | 11.a | Detection sources: application audit logs, WAF alerts, IDS/IPS alerts, anomaly detection, vulnerability scan results, and external threat intelligence. Alert routing: P1 and P2 alerts trigger PagerDuty/OpsGenie for immediate response; P3 alerts create tickets; P4 alerts are logged for review. Alert fatigue is managed through correlation, deduplication, and tuning. |
| SC-048 | Incident Containment | Procedures and tools for rapid containment of security incidents. Containment actions include: account suspension, session termination, network isolation, service shutdown, and evidence preservation. | Incident Management | 164.308(a)(6)(ii) | CC7.4 | 11.c | Automated containment actions can be triggered by detection rules: automatic account lockout for compromised credentials, automatic IP blocking for attack sources, automatic session termination for hijacked sessions. Manual containment actions are available through the administrative console. All containment actions are logged. |
| SC-049 | Breach Notification Management | The system tracks breach notification obligations and timelines. HIPAA requires notification to affected individuals within 60 days, to HHS without unreasonable delay, and to media (for breaches affecting 500+ individuals) within 60 days. | Incident Management | 164.308(a)(6)(ii), 164.400-414 | CC7.4 | 11.c | The breach management module tracks: breach discovery date, notification deadlines, affected individual count, notification status, and completion dates. Notification templates are provided for individual notifications, HHS notification, and media notifications. State breach notification requirements (which may have shorter timelines) are tracked. Risk assessment documentation determines whether notification is required under the harm threshold. |
| SC-050 | Post-Incident Review | All medium and high severity incidents undergo a post-incident review (blameless postmortem). Reviews document: incident timeline, root cause analysis, impact assessment, response effectiveness, and corrective actions. | Incident Management | 164.308(a)(6)(ii) | CC7.4 | 11.d | Post-incident reviews are conducted within 5 business days of incident closure. Reviews use the "5 Whys" root cause analysis methodology. Corrective actions are tracked in the risk register with assigned owners and deadlines. Lessons learned are shared with relevant teams. Incident trends are analyzed quarterly. |
| SC-051 | Disaster Recovery | Disaster recovery procedures enable restoration of system functionality and data following a catastrophic event. Recovery objectives follow a tiered model: Tier 1 (Clinical Services): RTO 15 min, RPO 5 min; Tier 2 (Supporting Services): RTO 30 min, RPO 15 min; Tier 3 (Non-Clinical): RTO 2 hours, RPO 1 hour; Tier 4 (Batch/Reporting): RTO 4 hours, RPO 1 hour. | Business Continuity | 164.308(a)(7)(i) | A1.2, A1.3 | 12.c | Database replication to a secondary region/zone provides near-real-time data protection. Application components are deployed across multiple availability zones. DNS failover routes traffic to the secondary region during a disaster. Recovery runbooks provide step-by-step procedures for each failure scenario. Recovery procedures are tested at least annually. |
| SC-052 | Backup and Recovery | Automated backup procedures protect all system data. Database backups: full daily, incremental hourly, transaction log continuous. File system backups: daily. Configuration backups: on change. Backup verification: daily integrity check, monthly restoration test. | Business Continuity | 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A) | A1.2 | 12.c | Backups are encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and stored in a separate region/account from production. Backup retention: daily backups for 30 days, weekly backups for 12 months, monthly backups for 7 years. Point-in-time recovery is available for the last 30 days. Backup monitoring alerts on failure. Restoration procedures are documented and tested. |
| SC-053 | High Availability | The system is designed for high availability with redundancy at every tier. Application servers run in an active-active configuration across multiple availability zones. Database uses synchronous replication within the primary region. Load balancers distribute traffic and detect unhealthy instances. | Business Continuity | 164.308(a)(7)(i) | A1.1, A1.2 | 12.c | Availability target: 99.9% (approximately 8.76 hours of downtime per year). Health checks run every 10 seconds. Unhealthy instances are removed from the load balancer within 30 seconds. Auto-scaling adjusts capacity based on demand. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. Graceful degradation maintains critical functionality during partial outages. |
| SC-054 | Business Continuity Plan | A documented business continuity plan ensures that critical business functions continue during and after a disruptive event. The plan identifies critical functions, recovery priorities, and resource requirements. | Business Continuity | 164.308(a)(7)(i) | A1.1 | 12.a, 12.b | Critical functions (in priority order): patient data access for active care, medication management, laboratory results delivery, new patient registration, billing and claims, reporting. Continuity procedures include manual fallback processes for extended outages. Communication plans define how staff, patients, and partners are notified during disruptions. |
| SC-055 | DR Testing and Validation | Disaster recovery procedures are tested regularly to validate their effectiveness. Testing methods include: tabletop exercises (quarterly), component failover tests (quarterly), and full DR tests (annually). Test results are documented and gaps are remediated. | Business Continuity | 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(D) | A1.3 | 12.e | Full DR tests simulate a complete regional failure and validate recovery within the defined RTO and RPO. Component tests validate individual failover mechanisms (database failover, load balancer failover, DNS failover). Tabletop exercises walk through response procedures with the incident response team. Test findings are tracked as risks in the risk register. Test reports are reviewed by organizational leadership. |

### 6.6 Application Security (SC-056 through SC-065)

| Control ID | Name | Description | Category | HIPAA Mapping | SOC 2 Mapping | HITRUST Mapping | Implementation Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-056 | Input Validation | All user input is validated at the API boundary before processing. Validation includes: type checking, length limits, format validation, allowed character sets, and business rule validation. Invalid input is rejected with descriptive error messages (without revealing implementation details). | Application Security | 164.312(c)(1) | PI1.2 | 09.m | Input validation is implemented in the API schema validation layer using JSON Schema and FHIR profile validation. Request body size limits are enforced (default: 10 MB). SQL injection is prevented through parameterized queries (no string concatenation for SQL). XSS is prevented through output encoding and Content Security Policy headers. |
| SC-057 | Output Encoding | All data rendered in HTML, JSON, XML, or other output formats is properly encoded to prevent injection attacks. Context-aware encoding is applied based on the output context (HTML body, HTML attribute, JavaScript, URL, CSS). | Application Security | 164.312(c)(1) | CC6.1 | 09.m | HTML output uses context-aware encoding via the template engine's auto-escape feature. JSON output is serialized using a safe JSON serializer that prevents injection. API responses include Content-Type headers that prevent MIME sniffing. Content Security Policy (CSP) headers restrict script execution to trusted sources. |
| SC-058 | CSRF Protection | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented for all state-changing operations. Protection mechanisms: SameSite=Strict cookie attribute, CSRF tokens for form submissions, and Origin header validation. | Application Security | 164.312(a)(1) | CC6.1 | 09.m | CSRF tokens are generated per session using a cryptographically random generator. Tokens are validated on every POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE request. The SameSite cookie attribute provides defense-in-depth. API endpoints using bearer token authentication are inherently CSRF-resistant. |
| SC-059 | Security Headers | HTTP security headers are configured on all responses to provide browser-level security protections. Headers include: Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy. | Application Security | 164.312(e)(1) | CC6.1 | 09.m | CSP: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff. X-Frame-Options: DENY. HSTS: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload. Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin. Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(). |
| SC-060 | Dependency Security | Third-party dependencies are managed with security controls. Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline. Vulnerable dependencies block deployment until patched or an exception is documented. License compliance is verified for all dependencies. | Application Security | 164.308(a)(1) | CC6.8 | 09.m | Dependency scanning uses Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools. Vulnerability databases are updated daily. Automated pull requests are created for security updates (Dependabot, Renovate). A software bill of materials (SBOM) is generated for each release (SPDX format). Transitive dependencies are included in the scan scope. |
| SC-061 | Secure Development Lifecycle | The development process follows a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) with security activities integrated at each phase. Activities include: threat modeling during design, secure coding standards during development, security testing during QA, and security review before deployment. | Application Security | 164.308(a)(1) | CC8.1 | 09.m | Developers receive annual secure coding training. Code reviews include security checklist items. SAST tools run on every pull request. DAST runs in the staging environment. Penetration testing is performed annually by an independent third party. Security bugs are triaged and prioritized alongside functional bugs. |
| SC-062 | Error Handling and Logging | Errors are handled securely to prevent information disclosure. Error messages to users are generic and do not reveal implementation details, stack traces, or database errors. Detailed error information is logged server-side for debugging. PHI is never included in error logs. | Application Security | 164.312(b) | CC7.1 | 09.ae | Error responses use standardized error codes and messages defined in the API specification. Stack traces are logged server-side with request context. Error logs are filtered to remove PHI using pattern-based redaction (SSN, MRN, date of birth patterns). Error rate monitoring alerts when thresholds are exceeded. |
| SC-063 | File Upload Security | File uploads are restricted to allowed file types and validated for content integrity. Uploaded files are scanned for malware before processing. File storage uses secure, randomized file names. Direct file serving is prohibited; files are served through an authenticated download endpoint. | Application Security | 164.312(c)(1) | CC6.1 | 09.m | Allowed file types are configurable (default: PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, DICOM, C-CDA XML). File type is validated by content inspection (magic bytes), not just extension. Maximum file size: 100 MB (configurable). Malware scanning uses ClamAV or cloud-native scanning services. Uploaded files are stored in a dedicated, non-executable storage location. |
| SC-064 | Rate Limiting and Throttling | API rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation. Rate limits are applied per user, per client application, and per IP address. Limits are configurable per endpoint based on expected usage patterns. | Application Security | 164.312(a)(1) | A1.1, CC6.6 | 09.m | Default rate limits: 1,000 requests per minute per user, 10,000 requests per minute per client application, 100 authentication attempts per hour per IP. Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) are included in API responses. Rate limit exceeded responses use HTTP 429 with a Retry-After header. Bulk data endpoints have separate, lower rate limits. |
| SC-065 | Secrets Management | Application secrets (database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, certificates) are managed through a dedicated secrets management system. Secrets are never stored in code, configuration files, or environment variables in plain text. | Application Security | 164.312(a)(2)(iv) | CC6.1 | 10.g | Secrets are stored in HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or equivalent. Secrets are injected at runtime through the secrets management agent or sidecar. Secrets are rotated on a configurable schedule (default: 90 days for most secrets, 24 hours for short-lived credentials). Secret access is logged. Secret scanning in CI/CD detects accidental secret commits and blocks the pipeline. |
